8-Puzzle Solver

Problem Statement

The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 3Ã—3 grid with eight numbered tiles and a single blank space. The objective is to arrange the tiles in numerical order by making valid moves (Up, Down, Left, Right) to shift the blank space while minimizing the number of moves required. The puzzle is widely used in artificial intelligence research as a benchmark problem for search algorithms. This project implements an A* search-based solver that efficiently finds the shortest path to the goal state using the Manhattan distance heuristic.
